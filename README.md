# data analysis using python

Here will be a collection of scripts, showing fairly basic or intermediate data analysis scripts. 

In the readme I will keep a list of scripts, and how those were developed 
(e.g. by using DeepSeek, Udemy learning, manual approach).

1) 
btc_correlation.py
 * was developed by using Deepseek, following prompt was used:
`How much was the Bitcoin value correlated with stocks of the US Stock market? How much was it correlated 
with Gold and silver market. Please show a correlation value for each week of the past 12 month. 
Create a csv file with the data and a Python Script to visualize the data using pandas and matplotlib.`
